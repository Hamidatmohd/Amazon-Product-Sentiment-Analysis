# Amazon-Product-Sentiment-Analysis

# Project Overview:
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning Algorithms to assess sentiments in product reviews. The analysis is presented through a Tableau Dashboard.

# Key Steps:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Importing libraries and datasets into a Jupyter notebook.
   - Conducting data cleaning and exploration.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Exploring data relationships using charts and graphs.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning review text using Spacy to remove stopwords, spaces, brackets, and hyperlinks.
   - Conducting lemmatization and tokenization.
   - Splitting the cleaned review text into train and test data sets.

4. Model Building:
   - Employing Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbour Classifier to construct sentiment analysis models based on the reviews.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Assessing model performance, with the Random Forest Classifier exhibiting the highest performance, followed by Logistic Regression, and K Nearest Neighbour performing least effectively.

6. Presentation:
   - Delivering a presentation showcasing the project steps, analysis, visualizations, insights, and recommendations.
